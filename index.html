    <p>I am sure if you saw the Great Pacific garbage patch, you would get an idea of the waste we throw out as a species. It is just one of the concentrations of plastic and waste debris out there. We always talk about recycling or reusing old stuff to protect the environment. It's probably easier to send away stuff so that it gets recycled. It's slightly more difficult to adapt a DIY approach and reuse old throwaways in a newer way.</p>

                There are a lot of benefits when you start thinking about upcycled DIY ideas from trash. For one, you can get rid of clutter around the house;
                 instead of holding on to that broken rocking chair with the distant hope of fixing it some day, you can turn it into a wall shelf right now.

            <h3>Fashion Designing</h3>
            <p>
                Upcycled clothing is the method of taking old, worn out or damaged materials and transforming them into brand new pieces. 
                Also referred to as repurposed clothing, 
                reused clothing and recycled clothing, upcyled garments are becoming increasingly popular in the contemporary fashion industry.

            <p>
                Upcycled papers, stash supplies, and cardboard from the recycling bin can all be of service to create
                 gift packaging that's unique and fits your personality
