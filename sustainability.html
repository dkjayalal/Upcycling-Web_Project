            <br>
            <p >According to the United Nations Brundland Commision, Sustainability is "meeting the needs of the present
                without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs". Sustainable Development
                Goals(SDGs) are the world's plan to achieve a better world for people and planet.
                SDGs are interconnected and consist of 17 goals and 169 targets which address the global challenges.

        <h2>The Role of Upcycling for achieving Sustainability</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Upcycling is the process of transferring waste materials or discarded items into a new product with a greater value and look.
            Upcycling plays a vital role for achieving Sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's have a look at how upcycling involves in sustainability.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="sdg_goal">
                <img src="images/sdg_8.jpg" style="margin-left: 10px;">
                <h3 style="margin-left: 10px;">SDG 8:Decent Work and Economic Growth</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Simply, Upcycling is the process of transforming waste into a new product with a value. 
                    So, it helps to reduce the wastage, reduce the waste management cost and reduce the money spent on buying new products 
                    in a household as well as in a country. Upcycling generates new job opportunities and helps to 
                    increase the ecocnomic growth in a country.
                </p>
            </div>

                <img src="images/sdg_9.jpg">
                <h3>SDG 9:Industry,Innovation and Infastructure</h3>
                    <p>Nowadays, consumers are seeking for more eco-friendly produts.
                       Therefore, there is a great demand for upcycled products.
                       Upcycling provides a lot of entrepreneurship opportunities as we can use our traditional craft skills to produce upcycled products
                       that can be sold in the global market. 
                       So that, upcycling is a great opportunity for small local businesses as well as rural village industries.
                    </p>

                <h3>SDG 12:Responsible Consumption and Production</h3>
                    <p>Upcycling contributes a lot in Responsible Consumption and Production. 
                        In the process of Upcycling, waste materials are not broken down into raw materials.
                        Hence, it uses less resources and reduces the production cost than recycling.
                        This concept can be applied in industries like textiles, jewellery, furniture and interior designing.

                <h3>SDG 13:Climatic action</h3>
                <p>Burning and dumping garbage can cause hazardous impact on the climate.
                   Emission of C02 and other harmful gases occurs when burning waste. Because of that, 
                   it damages the ozone layer and release UV rays.
                   Due to dissolving acidic components such as sulfuric or nitric acid with water, it causes acid rain.
                   This can be minimised by stopping dumping garbage here and there and upcycling them. 
                </p>
            </div>

                <h3>SDG 14:Life below Water</h3>
                <p>Upcycling helps to minimize the volume of discarded materials and the waste thrown into water bodies.
                   This is crucial because excessive waste can harm in number of ways.
                   It can damage the habitats of aquatic organisms.
                   Large number of aquatic animals are died in a year due to eating plastics and drinking poisonous water.
                   Finally, those dead bodies will end up in food chains and harm all the aquatic and non-aquatic animals.   
                </p>

                <h3>SDG 15:Life on Land</h3>
                <p>Most probably, waste matters are transported into wetlands or landfilling sites.
                    It affects all the living and non-living organisms in a bad way. Environmental pollution, spread of diseases,
                    loss of habitats and loss of bio-diversity are some of the harmful effects caused by the improper disposal of garbage.
                    As upcycling helps to reduce the amount of waste thrown into the environment, it helps to minimize the above effects and 
                    ensure the lives on land.
