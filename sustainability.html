        <p>Upcycling plays a vital role in SDG 12:Responsible Consumption and Production. 
            In the process of Upcycling, waste materials are not broken down into raw materials.
            Hence, it uses less resources and reduces the production cost than recycling.
            This concept can be applied in industries like textiles, jewellery, furniture and interior designing.
        </p>
        <h3 id="15">Life on Land</h3>
        <p>Most probably, waste matters are transported into wetlands or landfilling sites.
            It affects all the living and non-living organisms in a bad way. Environmental pollution, spread of diseases,
            loss of habitats and loss of bio-diversity are some of the harmful effects caused by the improper disposal of garbage.
            As upcycling helps to reduce the amount of waste thrown into the environment, it helps to minimize the above effects and 
            ensure the lives on land.
